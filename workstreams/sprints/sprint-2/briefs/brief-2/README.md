## 📌 Confirmed information

| Item | Current information |
| --- | --- |
| Sprint | Sprint 2 |
| Brief | Brief 2 |
| Team | Mehdi and Maroua |
| Project | Secure the existing LMS API and add the backend learning flow |
| Core stack | Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose |
| Required security | bcrypt password hashing, JWT, private routes, roles, ownership, and safe secrets |
| Main LMS flow | Courses, ordered modules, resources, enrollments, sequential progress, and trainer views |
| Verification | Postman or Insomnia plus focused automated tests with Supertest |
| Delivery track | Jira, Git branches or forks, pull requests and reviews, API docs, README, and Docker |
| Official title | No separate title was included in the supplied text |
| Official brief link | Not provided yet |
| Authentication decision | The brief explicitly requires a learner-built JWT flow using `jsonwebtoken` and bcrypt or bcryptjs |
| Clerk investigation | Learning reference only; it is not the selected implementation for this brief |
| Learning source | ChatGPT project `ghost ai`, conversation `Clerk CLI And MCP Explained` |
| Start date | 2026-10-05 |
| Deadline | 2026-10-16 |
| Assessment | 45 to 75 minute team defense with individual questions |
| Status | 🟡 In progress |

## 🗂️ Workspace

| Area | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Brief content](./brief-content/) | Supplied requirements and source details | ✅ Saved |
| [Brief analysis](./brief-analysis/) | Plain-language explanation, current gaps, risks, and visual roadmap | ✅ Analysis and visual pack ready |
| [Concepts](./concepts/) | Ordered technical learning roadmap | 🟡 Twelve concepts mapped; Concept 1 started |
| [Notes](./notes/) | Brief analysis, decisions, questions, and team responsibilities | 🟡 Full intake and current-code baseline recorded |
| [Exercises](./exercises/) | Short understanding practice for every concept | 🟡 Exercise roadmap ready; Concept 1 started |

## 🧭 Concept-by-concept workflow

1. Open the next concept in the [ordered roadmap](./concepts/).
2. Learn the idea with a 5 to 15 minute prediction, explanation, or micro-task.
3. Mehdi completes the linked exercise before receiving a full correction.
4. Keep full feature implementation and broad project verification in later checkpoints.
5. Save the concept lesson and visuals only after understanding is demonstrated.
6. Update the trackers and move to the next concept only when the checkpoint is verified.

## 🛡️ Scope boundary

The concept path focuses on the JavaScript backend: Node.js, Express, Mongoose, Zod, bcrypt, JWT, Multer, API design, and JavaScript tests. Required collaboration and delivery work is tracked separately so Jira, Git review, documentation, and Docker are not forgotten or confused with programming concepts.

## 🎯 Next step

Complete the short scenario in [Concept 1's exercise](./exercises/api-takeover-non-regression.md) and explain non-regression in your own words.
