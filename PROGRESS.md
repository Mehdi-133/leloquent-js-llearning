# Learning Progress

## Current position

- Current part: Part 1 - The JavaScript language
- Main direction: develop MERN JavaScript skills by connecting every practical concept to *Eloquent JavaScript*
- Current focus: starting the ordered concept path for Sprint 2 — Brief 2 with API takeover and non-regression
- Chapter status: In progress for the class presentation preparation
- Earlier chapters: Not completed; Chapter 1 remains not started
- Last meaningful update: 2026-10-09 - Recovered and registered the verified `jwt.verify()` middleware learning notes
- Next learning target: explain non-regression using one simple API-route scenario
- Next repository target: review the three answers in the Concept 1 quick exercise before any implementation work

## 🎤 Data-structures presentation checkpoint

> 🟢 **Ready to begin slide creation.** The core concepts have been studied through predictions, corrections, and MERN examples.
>
> Workspace: [`workstreams/presentations/javascript-data-structures/`](workstreams/presentations/javascript-data-structures/)

| Presentation area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Arrays, objects, references, mutation, and identity | ✅ Covered |
| `Map` for key-value lookup | ✅ Covered |
| `Set` for unique values | ✅ Covered |
| Traverse, transform, search, filter, sort, and group | ✅ Covered |
| Source data, derived structures, and JSON boundaries | ✅ Covered |
| Deep copying nested data with `structuredClone()` | 🔁 Review needed: prediction and explanation pending |
| Concept-owned pictures, diagrams, and explanations | ✅ Five visual packs complete: concept cards, exact diagrams, trackers, alt text, and explanations |
| Final `Array` vs `Object` vs `Map` vs `Set` comparison | 🟡 Complete inside the slides |
| Required mini-cases | 🟡 Turn the learned examples into audience questions |
| Slide design, final quiz, and oral rehearsal | 🟡 Existing deck reviewed; prepared visuals still need placement, final export, and rehearsal |

> 🧭 **Honest status:** the concept-learning foundation and visual asset system are ready. Canva placement, four code corrections, the final PDF inspection, audience activities, quiz, and presentation delivery still need to be completed.

## 🧑‍🏫 Mentor checkpoint — Sprint 1, Brief 3

> 🎉 **Result:** Brief 3 validated on 2026-10-07.
>
> The full feedback is stored in [`workstreams/sprints/sprint-1/briefs/brief-3/feedback/mentor-evaluation.md`](workstreams/sprints/sprint-1/briefs/brief-3/feedback/mentor-evaluation.md).

### ✅ Validated strengths

- Strong technical foundation: MVC, OOP, Repository pattern, interfaces/contracts, and Sequelize.
- Functional Express/EJS understanding: routes, dynamic parameters, filtering, controllers, and views.
- Healthy planning habit: describe the controller, route, view, and dynamic route in comments before coding.
- Good separation of responsibilities with a controller class and `this.hotels = hotels`.
- The remaining Express/EJS issues are mainly syntax recall, not missing understanding.
- The *Eloquent JavaScript* repository shows responsible use of AI as a learning coach.

### 🎯 Improvement priorities

- Practise Express routes, EJS views, dynamic parameters, array filters, and raw SQL without generative AI.
- Use short exercises regularly to make JavaScript syntax more automatic.
- Keep writing meaningful parts of each deliverable personally, even when it takes longer.
- Explain technical choices more clearly during oral presentations.
- Strengthen raw SQL, especially `JOIN` and filtered queries without Sequelize.

### 🛠️ Priority action tracker

| Practice task | Completion evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🏙️ `/hotels` filtered by city | Plan comments, controller, route, view, working result, and a 3-minute explanation | ⬜ Not started |
| ⭐ `/hotels` filtered by star count | Plan comments, controller, route, view, working result, and a 3-minute explanation | ⬜ Not started |
| 🛎️ `/hotels` filtered by `amenities` | Plan comments, controller, route, view, working result, and a 3-minute explanation | ⬜ Not started |
| 🗃️ One simple raw SQL `JOIN` | Handwritten query, verified result, and a clear explanation without Sequelize | ⬜ Not started |

### 🛡️ Learning rule

The first attempt is completed without generative AI: write the plan in comments, implement it, and explain the flow. AI may give a small hint or review the saved attempt afterward. A task becomes complete only when its behavior and explanation are both verified.

> 💡 **Remember:** AI is your coach and reviewer—not the person taking your practice attempt.

## Challenge statistics

| Statistic | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Practice challenges prepared | 3 |
| Challenges attempted | 1 |
| Challenges complete | 0 |
| Challenges needing review | 1 |
| Challenges not started | 2 |

- Latest evaluation: Challenge 04 - **5/10** (`Review needed`)
- Completion rate: **0%** - an attempt is counted as complete only after all required behavior is verified.

## Today's plan - 2026-10-07

- [x] Add Express and EJS as project dependencies and start Challenge 04.
- [ ] Correct the city-count reducer and verify all six city totals.
- [ ] Correct the most-expensive calculation and add the cheapest-car calculation.
- [ ] Match `GET /cars/stats`, run all checks, and request reevaluation.

Complete these tasks in order because each step prepares the next one.

The three unfinished tasks are mirrored as private all-day events in Mehdi's primary Google Calendar for today.

## Review queue

Add topics here when they need spaced repetition or another explanation.

- Express/EJS syntax: `res.render`, EJS tags, routes, and dynamic parameters.
- Array filtering without assistance.
- Raw SQL `JOIN` and filter queries.
- Three-minute explanations of technical choices.
- Clerk tool boundaries: runtime SDK vs development CLI vs optional AI MCP support.
- JWT verification middleware: Bearer parsing, `jwt.verify()`, `decoded.sub`, `req.user`, `next()`, and response-ending `return` statements.
